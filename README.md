# child-mortality-analysis
Child mortality is a core indicator for child health and well-being. The main objective of the project is to visualize and analyse the child mortal data so as to make people understand through visualization. We are trying to make an attempt to reach people around the globe and by letting them to known about facts and causes for the child mortality that has happened. However, traditional methods of analysing child mortality operations data are costly, rigid, and complex. Clinical and operations data must first be logged in applications and then cleansed and fit into a standard data model. When a change is required, database experts can require weeks or months to adjust the data model and prepare new reports. 
This report represents the latest estimates of under-five, infant mortality up to the year 2015 and assesses progress at the country, regional and global levels. This report is also provides an overview on the estimation methods used for child mortality indicators
